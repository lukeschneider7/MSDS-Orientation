# How Binomial and Normal Distributions Converge in the large N limit

## The Central Limit Theorem 

The Central Limit theorem states that is random samples of size n from a population with mean mu and std.deviation sigma, then the distributions of means of the samples approaches a normal distribution as the sample size n increases.
